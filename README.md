# Sudoku_Solver


## This is a simple script to solve the given sudoku board. 
<br>
This project was originally a python script but i wasn't satisfied with the input method i used in python (a list of lists). I decided to code the whole thing again in Javascript now it is easier to input a sudoku and solve it.
