# sudoku_Solver


This is a simple script to solve the given sudoku board. 

The current version does not have a good input method. I have a version that uses Tesseract-OCR to extract numbers from sudoku pictures. In that version you can just select a picture from your computer to solve. However in that version the OCR isn't as accurate as i want it to be so it is not included in this repo yet. When i get it working more accurately i will add it here.
